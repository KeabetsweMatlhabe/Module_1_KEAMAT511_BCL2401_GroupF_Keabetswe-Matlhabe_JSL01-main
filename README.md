## Areas of Mastery
Unicode in JavaScript: I feel confident in using Unicode in JavaScript to structure web page elements. Implementing these elemrnts was challenging but it ended up being my highlights of my web page.
Event Handling: I successfully implemented event listeners and handlers to enable interactive functionalities on the web page. This included features such as hover effects and button interactions, which added to the overall user experience.

## Challenges Faced
-Complex Interactions: Implementing more complex interactions and functionalities, such as animations and form validations, presented challenges. Exploring additional JavaScript libraries and frameworks may facilitate smoother implementation of such features in future projects.
-Mutable and Immutable:Struggle with differenciating the two objects and applying its theory without messing up the code.

## Areas for Improvement
-Algorithmic Thinking: Strengthening my understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts and algorithms would enhance my problem-solving skills and enable me to tackle more complex programming tasks with confidence.
-Code Optimization: While achieving the desired outcomes, there's room for improvement in optimizing JavaScript code for performance and efficiency. Refactoring code segments and adopting best practices can lead to cleaner and more maintainable solutions.

## Overall Learning Experience
-This project provided valuable hands-on experience in applying JavaScript fundamentals to web development. Through tasks such as DOM manipulation and event handling, I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript's role in enhancing interactivity and functionality on web pages.
